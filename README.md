# Zend Framework Library for Amazon Alexa Skills

This library depends on the basic PHP library for building your own PHP based Amazon 
Alexa skills. It adds a couple of useful factory classes based on `Zend\ServiceManager` 
and some middleware classes ready to use for your middleware pipeline. It also contains
an Intent-Manager based on `Zend\ServiceManager` to make intent class handling as easy 
as possible for your applications.
